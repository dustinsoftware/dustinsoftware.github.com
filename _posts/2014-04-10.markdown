A couple gotcha's I ran into recently:

### MySQL.Data does not handle storing UTF-8 strings correctly by default.

It will turn this:

> logos = λόγος

Into this:

> logos = ?????

To avoid MySQL.Data silently dropping UTF-8 characters, make sure your connection string contains `Charset=utf8mb4`.  Why use `utf8mb4` instead of `utf8`?

### 'Charset=utf8' does not support the full UTF-8 character set

MySQL's `utf8` uses a maximum of 3-bytes to store each character and does not contain all UTF-8 characters (like 𝌆).  This is slightly less terrible than silently losing data, and will cause a MySQL error at run-time when inserting an unsupported character.  For example:

>  Incorrect string value: '\xF0\x9F\x92\xA9' for column 'data' at row 1
