I was reading a few blogs online the other day, and read that having a programming blog is one of the best thing you can do as a programmer, for a number of reasons.  I'll try to keep this blog up to date as best as I can, although I would really like to get moving on writing a blog engine written in something fun like [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and move it to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)!  But that's a project for another time.

Today's link: [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/), a PHP framework I used to program [The Campus Bullet](http://campusbullet.net) ([source available here](https://github.com/LETU/Campusbullet)).
