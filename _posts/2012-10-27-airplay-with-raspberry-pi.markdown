One of the main reasons I bought a Raspberry Pi is because of its awesome potential as a home media center with a low footprint (electrical and space).  If you haven't heard of the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs), it's a credit-card sized computer with an ARM-based Broadcom SoC, 512 MB of RAM, an SD card slot, HDMI out, a 10/100 ethernet port, and two USB ports, among other things.  There are many Linux distributions to choose from, but for my purposes, all I needed was something that could handle Airplay video and AirTunes from my iPad (yes, I have an iPad because work gave it to me, my first choice was an Android-based tablet but I already have a HP Touchpad running CM9).<!-- more -->

I was using Raspbmc for a while, based off of the popular XBMC, but Airplay support isn't quite mature enough on it yet.  Today I made the switch to [OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/) and it's running much better.

If you have a Raspberry Pi and would love to try OpenELEC, just grab an SD card (I used a 4 GB card but your results may vary), the latest image from [here](http://openelec.thestateofme.com/official_images/), and write it to the SD card using your favorite disk imaging utility.  Because I use Windows, [Win32DiskImager](http://www.softpedia.com/get/CD-DVD-Tools/Data-CD-DVD-Burning/Win32-Disk-Imager.shtml) worked great for me.  Don't forget to use a micro-USB cable that can supply enough energy to your Pi, or it might freak out during the boot process.
