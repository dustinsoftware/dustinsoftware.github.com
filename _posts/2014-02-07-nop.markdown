title: NOP Instructions in .NET

When compiled, when is this...

```
if (foo == bar)
{
  DoAction();
}
```

...different from this?

```
if (foo == bar)
  DoAction();
```

The compiler generates NOP instructions when building in Debug mode when braces are present, allowing a breakpoint to be set.  When building in Release mode, however, these two blocks of code generate the same IL.
